# DatabaseManagement
This is a simple Database Management System implemented using MySql database for DBMS. A project i worked on to understand how database system works. A web application was also created using python,flask and jinja2. necessary files and documentation to setup the virtual environment is uploaded.
The Documents are uploaded phase wise. phase 1 being the start of my project and phase 4 the end of it.
Documents related to each phase is attached with the file.
I recommend to setup a virtual environment and download the necessary libraries in the virtual environment to keep record of individual projects and their libraries.
If using python use command pip list to check all the packages available to you in the current environment.
